  <h1>Hire us</h1>

  <p>We specialise in web development using JavaScript, Node.js and AngularJS. <a href="#contact">Contact us</a>.</p>

  <h2>Permanent recruitment</h2>

  <p>We have a regular stream of excellent junior developers coming through our coding bootcamp and we always have a long list of high-quality CVs that you can look at. We offer a recruitment service with a simple flat fee that helps us defray the costs of running our course.</p>

  <h2>Prototyping</h2>

  <p>If you have an idea for a web application and want to see it realised, we will get a team of our recent graduates to build a working prototype for you in just a week.</p>

  <p>We charge a flat fee, all of which goes to the students, and if you are not happy with the results, you pay nothing.</p> 

  <p>After the completion of the prototype, you can continue to retain our developers to do more work for you. Our graduate developers are paid at the London Living Wage.</p>

  <h2>Contract developers</h2>

  <p>We can provide more experienced developers on a temporary basis to work with your in-house development team.</p>

  <h2>Outsourcing</h2>

  <p>You can outsource some or all of your development to us. As well as our recent graduates, we have a community of experienced freelance developers whose skills we can draw on.</p>

  <h2>Training</h2>
  
  <p>Ask us about any training needs you might have. We can adapt our curriculum to your needs.</p>

  <h2>About us</h2>

  <p>We are a not-for-profit social enterprise. Our full-time training programme and software apprenticeship attracts applications from extraordinarily talented people from around the UK and abroad, all of whom share a passion for code.</p>

  <p>We are the very definition of a lean startup with just one paid director and no permanent staff at all. Instead our business is run by our graduates, most of whom eventually leave us for employment elsewhere, but not before they achieve a high level of competence in their chosen areas of specialisation.</p>

  <p>We are an organisation like no other. We aim to bridge the digital skills gap, turn talented people into software developers, and provide an excellent service to our clients and partners. All of our profits go back into improving the quality of our training programmes and supporting our graduates into employment.</p>

GLOBE TOWN, LONDON - A new not-for-profit coding bootcamp has just opened in Globe Town, East London, attracting applications from all over London, the UK and abroad.

With an increasing shortage of software skills in London and the rising costs of education and training, *Founders & Coders* aims to fill the gap with a full-time training programme that prepares students for employment as software developers in the burgeoning London tech scene.

Unusually, the course is entirely free to participants. And in the latter parts of the training, students even get paid while they work on real client projects.

The company operates on a shoestring with just one paid director and no permanent staff at all. Instead the business is run largely by the students and graduates of the programme. Any profits go back into improving the quality of the training and supporting graduates into employment.

Says company founder, Dan Sofer: "The feedback we have had from everyone has been amazing. I have been just overwhelmed with the number and quality of applicants to the course and with the interest shown from employers. Most of all it has been a delight to watch my students, through effort and determination, transform themselves in just a few weeks from complete beginners into accomplished software developers and company co-founders."

All of Dan's co-founders attended an earlier version of the course that he piloted in Camden Town before moving to the new premises in Tower Hamlets, and they will all now be helping to deliver the new training programme while they also work on a variety of freelance projects for commercial clients.

The first course at the new campus starts on January 26th and applications have now opened for the next cohort in May.

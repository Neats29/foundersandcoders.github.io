GLOBE TOWN, LONDON - A new not-for-profit web agency is offering to get a team of developers to build you a prototype web app for just £500.

The service is designed to help early-stage startups, which might otherwise struggle to get their foot in the door, to build a minimal viable product that will impress potential investors and customers.

The agency is part of *Founders & Coders*, a new and heavily over-subscribed academy that aims to bridge the digital skills gap and turn talented people into software developers. It attracts applications from around London, the UK and abroad.

Muduno, a London-based startup, originally hired a graduate team from *Founders & Coders* to build a prototype and have continued to use them. Muduno CEO, Tom Humphreys, says, *"Founders & Coders have been a game changing resource for our business. They had the knowledge and work ethic to deliver our product from concept stage. With each project they have exceeded our expectations in terms of cost, product quality and time scale. It’s a pleasure to work with such an enthusiastic development team."*

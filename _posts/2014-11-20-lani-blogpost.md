Following a Masters in International Politics in 2011 I worked in policy and research, coordinating projects which looked at issues around participation, community development and international relations. During this period I developed an growing interest in the digital sphere. I was desperate to further my understanding of web development by getting some hands-on experience so that I could move into the digital sphere, but couldn’t afford to retrain.

In February 2014 I successfully applied for the free Founders & Coders course, and undertook an eight-week intensive course providing me with a whirlwind introduction to Python, Github, Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. After completing the course, the organiser, Dan Sofer, arranged for me to take on a  freelance role building a [website for a small business]. He also provided me with an account for project management tool, [Pivotal Tracker], a widely used agile programme. The practical experience was invaluable. 

I haven’t looked back since. A few months after completing the course I successfully applied for a role in the digital transformation team of Southbank Centre, a large Arts charity with an ambitious digital programme. As project officer I do a little bit of everything, from analysing web traffic, wireframing, facilitating focus groups, user testing, technical testing and content editing, to researching great UX design and innovative online tools. The knowledge I learned at Founders & Coders provided me with an integral foundation upon which I am constantly building.

The impact Founders & Coders had on me cannot be under-estimated and I am eternally grateful to Dan Sofer for his dedicated teaching and infectious passion, as well as Camden Collective for the space and resources they provided. I wish Dan and his Mile End school the best of luck for the future, keep up the amazing work!

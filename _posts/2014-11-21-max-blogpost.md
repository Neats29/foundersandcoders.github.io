I've been through the ringer, like most of us, when it comes to education. Same old story, finish college, do uni and then maybe get something that pays well because you've 'done uni'... or maybe not. At no point, as far back as I can remember, have I been engaged with education; I have of course participated but not wantonly. 

I was losing hope, that was...  until my lord and saviour Dan placed me on the righteous path of web development accompanied by an array of enlightening frameworks. That may be a tad grandiouse admittedly, however, working with Dan and being part of the 'Founders and Coders' experience has been incredibly refreshing and surpassed all my expectations.

I have come to the conclusion that coding is addictive, no pipe and tinfoil necessary; all you need is wifi and a laptop. For the first time in my life I found myself lost in my work and addicted to it. Falling asleep with your laptop in intimate embrace and awakening to a willful resuming of coding activities would not have been as enjoyable without an assortment of similarly addicted participants.

In conclusion I am confident that whatever your predisposition to education is, learning in this environment is something that anyone interested in or already consumed by code would relish.

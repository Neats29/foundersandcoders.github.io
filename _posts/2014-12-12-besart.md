There is something incredibly powerful about working in small teams on ambitious open-ended projects. It plays with our core sensibilities&mdash;our fundamentals. We are social animals. Our fear of letting others down, our desire to compete, our ability to learn through watching, doing and&mdash;eventually&mdash;teaching. There are many institutions that operate in a similar way, but, for one reason or another, very few of them are educational. Schools and universities split people up, for sorting and testing. This one-dimensional isolating way of learning is a mistake. The model that Dan has built is different and a significant improvement.

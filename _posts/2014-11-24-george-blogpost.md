It feels as if I've been sprinting ahead of a runaway train the last five months and this is the first time I've sidestepped the tracks, paused for breath and looked around to see where I've found myself. Bloody hell but my life has changed utterly - I'm working! for the first time in a decade... I'm immersed in an inspiring learning culture, I'm surrounded by amazing people and I'm happy. Ridiculously happy. 

Learning coding from scratch at breakneck speed while skimming the rules and sometimes taking the path of most resistance to solve problems is a continuous source of heartache and delight - massive frustration, bleak inadequacy, impostor syndrome building up and up 'til banished by that shining odd Eureka moment. I feel incredibly lucky to have stumbled across FoundersandCoders and into this vocation at a time when the best minds in the industry share their knowledge openly and the bleeding edge of technology is free for everyone to tinker with and bastardise to any imaginable end. 

Combine this cascade of information with highly motivated people under collaborative pressure and gentle direction and you get FoundersandCoders! I am unbelievably privileged to have learned and worked alongside such stellar people and to have found an inspirational mentor in Dan. He's hit upon a powerful model that's evolving with each cohort and I can't wait to see what happens in the months and years to come. I only wish I could go through it all again - Viva la Revolucion!

  <h3>Courses</h3>

  <p><strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/insidetheinternet/"><em>Internet History, Technology, and Security</em></a></strong>. A well-rated and largely non-technical course from the the University of Michigan on Coursera.</p>

  <p><strong>Stanford's <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/about"><em>Computer Science 101</em></a></strong>. CS101 is a gentle introduction to programming concepts that uses (a slightly doctored version of) JavaScript, so it is perfect for our purposes. Expect to spend about 10-15 hours on it, including watching the lectures and completing the exercises.</p>

  <h3>Exercises</h3>

  <p><a href="http://flukeout.github.io/#"><strong>CSS Diner</strong></a>. A great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are: <em>plate</em>, <em>bento</em> and <em>#fancy</em>. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript"><strong>Codewars</strong></a>. Sign up and see how far you can get with their JavaScript exercises.</p>

  <h3>Reading</h3>

  <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX"><strong>Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant</strong></a>. <em>"Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right...But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups"</em>.</p>

  <h3>Watching</h3>

  <p><a href="http://youtu.be/5Tk09c0FQ3M"><strong>Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future</strong></a>, a talk by Ed Lazowska.</p>

  <p><a href="http://youtu.be/gTAghAJcO1o"><strong>The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental</strong></a>, a talk by Alan Kay.</p>

  <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366"><strong>Inventing on Principle</strong></a>, a talk by Bret Victor.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB"><strong>Crockford on JavaScript</strong></a>. A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow). You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course.</p>

  <h3>Typing</h3>

  <p>Learn to touch type. And make sure that you know not just the main letter keys, but all the outer keys, too. There are many good teaching apps, but <a href="http://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free).</p>

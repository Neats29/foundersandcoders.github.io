<h2>Get something built</h2>

<p>Got an idea but not sure about the technical side?
We can help take your idea off of the sketchpad and into production. If you are not sure where to start, we can help by providing technical consultancy. Have some idea on the tech side but need muscle to make it a reality? We can help you construct a first prototype and go from there.<p>

<h2>Hire our graduates</h2>

<p>Good junior developers are hard to come by. The typical procurement and recruitment processes is expensive and you often don't know what you're getting. We provide an alternative.</p>

<p>You can invite graduates to tackle your tech problems on a freelance basis. They get paid the full amount of the work they do, so they can support themselves while continuing their education. At the same time, you get an idea of their quality.</p>

<p>This is a very cost-effective way of getting to know potential employees.</p>

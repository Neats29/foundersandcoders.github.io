<h4>What are the hours of study?</h4> 
<p>Classes run Monday to Friday, 10am-6pm, but the campus is open outside these hours, too.</p>

<h4>How is the classroom organised?</h4> 
<p>Courses are project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.</p>

<h4>What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?</h4> 
<p>The skills it will give you. The quality of the learning experience. The Founders & Coders community.</p>

<h4>Who is this programme suitable for?</h4>
<p>There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning our programme requires. You need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.</p>

<h4>Will I be a productive developer after the end of the programme?</h4>
<p>We reckon that it takes perhaps 1,000 hours to become a somewhat competent full-stack JavaScript developer. That will take about six months, working 40 hours a week. The first eight weeks of the programme will give you a good foundation, but it wonâ€™t get you all the way there. The second eight weeks is designed to get you to the point where you will be able to support yourself through coding.</p>

<h4>What sorts of projects will I work on in the second half of the programme?</h4>
<p>We will attempt to find a wide variety of commercial web projects for paying clients.</p>

<h4>Will I be paid in the second half of the programme?</h4>
<p>We cannot guarantee any level of income. What we will offer is continued mentoring and support while you find your feet.</p>

<h4>Will you make a profit on the work I do in the second half of the programme?</h4>
<p>We do not expect to. Our first priority is for our students to be able to earn the equivalent of the London Living Wage by the end of the programme. This is an ambitious target for an inexperienced developer. We do not expect to generate any surplus.</p>

<h4>What happens at the end of the programme?</h4>
<p>There are two outcomes that we are aiming for: either you find employment as a developer (preferably with one of our partners organisations) or you join the Founders & Coders community as a freelance developer.</p>

<h4>What does joining the Founders & Coders community entail?</h4>
<p>You will be invited to remain at our Campus in Mile End, help us develop our programme, mentor future cohorts of students, and continue to develop your own freelance practice.</p>

<h4>How are you supporting yourselves?</h4>
<p>We are supporting ourselves by working on freelance projects provided by our partners and clients. Currently, none of us are paid for the teaching or mentoring on the programme.

<h4>Who are your partners?</h4>
<p>It is very early days. We have only just started reaching out to potential partners, but they already include a digital agency with whom we have previously placed our graduates, a local authority, a publishing company, a handful of established businesses, and some early-stage startups.</p>

<p>We have developed an educational environment which nurtures commitment, community and hard work. With the support of our alumni, we expect our model to be self-sustaining and replicable. Education should not be an expensive and isolated experience; it should be free and communal. Eventually, we want our courses - and similar projects - to be available everywhere.</p>

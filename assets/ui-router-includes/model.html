<p>Founders and Coders is a community of developers and a coding academy. We are a not-for-profit <em>Community Interest Company</em>. All of our profits go back into improving the quality of our training programmes and supporting our graduates into employment.</p> 

<p>We run a 16-week programme. For the first 8 weeks, students take part in our intensive full-stack web-development course. For the second, students are invited to remain in our space, where they will team up with mentors to work on external, paid projects, under the guidance of a mentor.</p>

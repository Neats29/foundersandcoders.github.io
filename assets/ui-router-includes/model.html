<p>Founders and Coders is a community of developers and a coding academy. We are a community interest company which means we are a social enterprise that aims to use our profits and assets for the public good.</p> 

<p>We run a 16-week programme. For the first 8 weeks, students take part in our intensive full-stack web-development course. For the second, students are invited to remain in our space, where they will team up with mentors to work on external, paid projects, under the guidance of a mentor.</p>

<p>We are currently fundraising on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/founders-coders-a-free-coding-academy-in-london/x/9150368">Indiegogo</p>

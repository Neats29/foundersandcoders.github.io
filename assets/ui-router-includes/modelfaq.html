<h4>Is Founders & Coders just a coding academy?</h4>
<p>It is not just a coding academy, it is a freelance community, with a school at its centre.</p>

<h4>What is the idea behind Founders & Coders?</h4>
<p>That a good education can also be free.</p>

<h4>How can you make education free?</h4> 
<p>Firstly, by driving the costs of tuition down. Secondly, by building a strong alumni community. Thirdly, by creating partnerships with employers.</p>

<h4>How can you drive down the costs of education without affecting quality?</h4>
<p>By working only with highly-motivated students, by using peer-led learning techniques, and by building a strong alumni community.</p>

<h4>Don’t you need well-paid and highly-qualified teachers?</h4>
<p>We are not convinced on this point. We are big believers in peer-led learning. We also think that recent graduates make excellent teachers and that teaching can accelerate their own learning.</p>

<h4>Do you not have any experienced mentors or teachers?</h4> 
<p>Yes we do, but they largely give their time voluntarily and we use them sparingly.</p>

<h4>Why is a strong alumni community important?</h4>
<p>Because we rely on our alumni to deliver the curriculum, to act as mentors to our students, and to continue to develop the programme.</p>

<h4>How do you encourage a strong community?</h4> 
<p>Select applicants with high levels of commitment, provide them with a great learning environment, find projects for them to work on after they graduate, and then encourage them to remain on-campus to continue to develop their skills and to mentor the next student cohort.</p>

<h4>What sorts of support do you need from commercial partners?</h4>
<p>Primarily, a willingness to provide our students and alumni with projects and employment.</p>

<h4>How realistic is this model?</h4> 
<p>Very. It is already working. Our graduates are finding work, both independently and through our partners, many of them are committed to joining us at the new campus, and we have started to build strong working relationships with employers.</p>

<h4>If this model works, why is nobody else doing it?</h4>
<p>We don’t know, although it is probably not easy without a committed group of people behind it. We are open sourcing our syllabus, in case anyone else wants to try.</p>
